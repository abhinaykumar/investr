# Investr

Idea is very similar to what https://sqrrl.in/ is doing through their mobile app. 

This is going to be a web based application, which would keep track of expenses via emails and 
notify user about the spare change they could invest in the mutual funds or stocks.


## Roadmap:
* Integrate Social Auth :white_check_mark:

  * Field to enter email ids
  * Display content as preview
  * Ask user to point out the field to track
